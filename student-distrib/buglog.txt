CP2:

	- GDT info not cleared from screen while testing keyboard. FIXED: Clearing the screen at startup.
	
	- Right shift key would caps lock after being pressed once. FIXED: Changed value of Right Shift key
	
	- When text buffer was filled up, backspaced would clear characters off screen and not the buffer.
	FIXED: Keyboard interrupt handler would write more characters than the buffer would handle which was more
	characters than the conditions allowed, which caused nothing to happen to the buffer when backspacing.
	Changed a number to not allow too many characters to be written to the buffer.
	
	- Scrolling not working. Each character would be on a new line. FIXED: Changed boundary conditions and buffer for scrolling.
	
	- Read directory was just printing out the directory. FIXED: Write the directory to the buffer and not to the screen.
